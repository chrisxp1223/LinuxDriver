   4.1 Driver Package Creation

     4.1.1 with DKMS
       [NOTE] to create a package with DKMS, please install the dkms.
              $ sudo apt-get install dkms

       Following is the steps for the package creation.
       $ sudo cp -r ~/amddiagdriver /usr/src/amddiag-X.YY
       $ cd /usr/src/amddiag-X.YY/
       [NOTE] X.YY is the package version specified in the dkms.conf, not the
              driver version.
       $ vi dkms.conf
       [NOTE] the PACKAGE_VERSION in the dkms.conf must be matched to X.YY
       $ sudo dkms add -m amddiag -v X.YY
       $ sudo dkms build -m amddiag -v X.YY
       $ sudo dkms mkdeb -m amddiag -v X.YY
       [NOTE] as the result, debian package of the driver will be created under
              /var/lib/dkms/amddiag/X.YY/deb/amddiag-dkms_X.YY.deb
